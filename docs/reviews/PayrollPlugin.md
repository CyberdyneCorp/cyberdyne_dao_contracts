## Plugin-specific focus areas

These are the highest-risk invariants for this plugin — confirm each explicitly:

1. Permissionless `executePayroll` / `executePayrollPage` crank cannot be abused to double-pay a period or skip the once-per-month idempotency guard.
2. Salary transfers are mandatory (audit H-01): the batch runs with `allowFailureMap = 0`, a failed/false-returning salary reverts the whole crank, and the period is never marked complete unless every salary paid. Confirm the bounty is the only failable leg and `KeeperBountyPaid` is success-aware (H-02), and that ERC20 payouts route through `SafeTransferHelper` (M-04).
3. Pagination cursor (`payoutCursor`/`cursorPeriod`) is monotonic and cannot strand or replay recipients across pages; recipient-set mutations are frozen mid-pagination (M-03).
4. Keeper-bounty accounting respects `bountyMaxPerPeriod`, is awarded only on a full/final page (L-01), and `setKeeperBounty` rejects an unfundable config (L-04).
5. Force-pay recovery (`executeForcePayPeriod`) is bounded by `MAX_FORCE_BACK_MONTHS`, vote-gated, and guarded against double-pay via `forcePaidPeriod` (M-02).
6. Vendored BokkyPooBah date library matches upstream byte-for-byte (no tampering).

### Security review checklist

Each reviewer confirms (or files a finding for) every line:

- [ ] **Access control** — every state-mutating function is gated by the correct permission ID; no missing `auth(...)` modifier.
- [ ] **Custody** — the plugin never custodies funds or NFTs; the DAO is `msg.sender`/recipient on every external call.
- [ ] **Reentrancy** — no state mutated after an external call without protection; governance path avoids nested `dao.execute`.
- [ ] **Arithmetic** — no unchecked overflow/underflow; casts are safe or bounded.
- [ ] **External calls** — return values checked; approvals scoped and reset; no unbounded approval.
- [ ] **Upgrade safety** — storage layout matches `audits/internal/01-storage-layouts.md`; `__gap` preserved; initializers gated.
- [ ] **Input validation** — zero-address / zero-amount / out-of-range inputs revert with named errors.
- [ ] **DoS / gas** — loops are bounded (pagination); a single bad actor cannot brick a shared path.
- [ ] **Events** — every state change emits the documented event with correct args (see `audits/internal/05-functions-events.md`).
- [ ] **Slither** — all findings reviewed against the per-plugin waiver table (`audits/internal/02-slither.md`); no unwaived High/Medium.
- [ ] **Tests** — coverage ≥ 90% (lines + branches); fork tests pass on `mainnetFork` + `baseFork`; no `it.only`/`vm.skip`.
- [ ] **Spec parity** — behavior matches the plugin spec doc; no undocumented privileged surface.
